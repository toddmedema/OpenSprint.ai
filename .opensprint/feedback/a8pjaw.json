Changing the theme from either location must immediately update the other and apply the theme globally. Acceptance criteria: (1) A 'Display' section appears at the bottom of the settings list. (2) The section contains a theme picker with Light, Dark, and System options. (3) Selecting a theme persists to localStorage at `opensprint.theme` and applies immediately. (4) The navbar toggle and the settings toggle stay in sync. (5) Default value is System for new users.",
