# OpenSprint Glossary

Orchestrator and execution concepts. See [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) for workflow details.

## Core Concepts

| Term                    | Definition                                                                                                                               |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Worktree**            | Git worktree for a task at `.opensprint/worktrees/<task-id>/`. Equivalent to Gas Town's Hook. Survives backend restarts.                 |
| **Assignment**          | `assignment.json` in `.opensprint/active/<task-id>/` — everything an agent needs to self-start. Enables GUPP-style crash recovery.       |
| **Nudge**               | Event that triggers the orchestrator loop (agent done, feedback submitted, Execute! clicked, or loop kicker tick).                       |
| **Loop kicker**         | 60s timer that nudges when the orchestrator loop is idle. Runs inside the orchestrator.                                                  |
| **Watchdog**            | 5-min health patrol (stale heartbeats, orphaned tasks, stale `.git/index.lock`). Runs in a separate `WatchdogService` (Witness pattern). |
| **Progressive backoff** | Deprioritize then block tasks after repeated failures. See PRD §9.1.                                                                     |

## Recovery

| Term               | Definition                                                                                                                |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **GUPP-style**     | "If work on your Hook, you must run it." Write `assignment.json` before spawn so crash recovery can re-read and re-spawn. |
| **Crash recovery** | Three scenarios on startup: no active task; PID alive (resume monitoring); PID dead (revert, comment, requeue).           |
